## Wheelchair Connect: web-application

**Project description:** A web application that solves a duplicate service. Due to a problem which is patients want to receive wheelchairs, but providers or institutes can't check that the patient already received the wheelchair or not. So, our solution will solve this problem and make the service more convenient and correctly by connecting each institute together and view the information via REST API. The project using .NET 4.0 framework, ASP .NET Core for the API provider, ASP .NET MVC for the web-based application, and MySQL for the database.
